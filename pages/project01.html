				SUMMARY
			</div>
			<div class="small_text summary" lang="en">
				This thesis is a proposal for the regeneration of the most neglected part of Belgrade, its central riverfront. The aim of the design is to highlight the waterfront's potential, while reconnecting it with the city throught the use of green spaces (exisiting and new). 
			</div>
			<div class="small_text summary" lang="en">
				One of the main obstacles towards the future development of the city of Belgrade in spatial term, is the city's lack of effective connection with its riverfront. This disconnection is related to the city's historical and spatial developmentand presents itself in different forms (geomorphology, infrastructural, physical barriers, accessibility, ownership, etc.).
			</div>
			<div class="small_text summary" lang="en">
				Five connecting strategies where applied into the design of the waterfront's master plan, as well as into the design of the 3 selected areas (the industrial port, the touristic harbor and the marina in Dorcol).
			</div>
			<div class="small_text summary" lang="en">
				The proposal integrates elements from the past of the site into the future plans of developmentfor this area, in a bubtle way. The new design combines the preservation of characteristic elements found in the industrial and urban landscape of Belgrade's riverfront with the new internventions which connect it with the city. The proposal is based on the ecological theory of green infrastructure and green corridors. The application of the above concepts in the territory of Belgrade's former industrial waterfront improves its accessibility and public use, while on the same time provides the ecological link which is currently missing.
